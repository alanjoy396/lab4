A software license is important for open source software because it ensures it upholds the four essential freedoms of free software. It ensures that the code is used properly, and, while being freely distributed, still imposes certain rules on those who derive from it. At the same time, it ensures that the rules cannot be retroactively changed after you already acquire the software. Overall, the license is there to protect the original software developer, those who would use the software, and those who would create derivative software from it.
