A software license is important for open source software because it ensures it upholds the four essential freedoms of free software. It ensures that the code is used properly, and, while being freely distributed, still imposes certain rules on those who derive from it. At the same time, it ensures that the rules cannot be retroactively changed after you already acquire the software. Overall, the license is there to protect the original software developer, those who would use the software, and those who would create derivative software from it.

If a software does not have a license, there is a danger in using it in that the user is not protected from any rules the user might impose after the fact. The license should ensure that the program can be run and used freely, but if there is no license, there is no way to know if you are "allowed" to use or modify the source code. There is nothing protecting your usage of the program, so it is generally a bad idea to use a program without an explicit license.

I think the Gopher team did make the mistake of not following the open source model properly. They did not make the software open and free to everyone equally, as seen with how they charged for .com websites, but not for .edu websites. They also did not properly bring developers onto their team to make the project strong enough that forking it ended up splintering it into many options without a strong base. Overall, they failed to follow the open source model, so people didn't use the program.

Linux has chosen to use the GPL v2 license generally, because of their belief in Open Source. According to [this website](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2), the GPL v2 license allows for commercial usage, modifications, distribution of modifications, and warranties, while banning sublicensing. This all serves to uphold the [tenants of open source](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated), and protect those who would create derivative works for Linux.

We came up with a project that would basically be the inspect element function of html, but you would be able to save your modified version of a web page locally. I think GNU GPL v3 would be pretty suitable for this, because it would encourage the community to collaborate to make the software better.

The GPL v2 license allows for free copying, distribution, and modification of source files as long as you keep track of changes in the source files. Any modifications to GPL-licensed code must be made available openly. The major difference between GPL v2 and v3 is that v3 adds a clause that GPL v3 describes the rights to practice patent claims. LGPL is similar to GPL, but allows derivative works that only use an LGPL-licensed library to not have LGPL. Apache allows for free usage, modification, and distribution of software, but requires that certain notices and trademarks are included. For developers, Apache is best, because it allows developers to generally do as they please with open-source software. For companies, LGPL is better, because it allows code to still be closed-source while letting others do your work with the open-source parts of your code. For the common good, GPL is best, because it allows for the best work to be shared openly.

I will probably work on the Schedj project from RCOS throughout this course. Schedj is supposed to use the YACS api to allow students to schedule for a semester, and then take that schedule and upload it directly to SIS. It will most likely be a multi-semester project, and I might have to pass it on to someone else. Ideally, most RPI students would start using this, because it's designed for all students to use for scheduling. The license being used is the Apache license v2.0, because it allows for free modification but guarantees the trademark of the original work is preserved.
